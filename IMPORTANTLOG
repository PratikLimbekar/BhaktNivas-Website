So, Prisma is idiotically idiot.

While running your index.js, i.e. the following code:
import express from "express";
import { Prisma, PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";

const prisma = new PrismaClient();

it gives the following error:
PrismaClientInitializationError: `PrismaClient` needs to be constructed with a non-empty, valid `PrismaClientOptions`:

This is due to us using Prisma 7.
What we should do is:
PostgreSQL requires the official adapter.
So,
npm install @prisma/adapter-pg

And then instantiate the Prisma Client using that:
import 'dotenv/config';
import { PrismaPg } from '@prisma/adapter-pg'
import { PrismaClient } from '../generated/prisma/client'

const connectionString = `${process.env.DATABASE_URL}`

const adapter = new PrismaPg({ connectionString })
const prisma = new PrismaClient({ adapter })
